# Agent-Prepared Batch API Workflow

[中文版](./2026-09-23-agent-prepared-batch-api.zh-CN.md)

Status: implemented alongside this document (2026-09-23), on top of the
low-level `qwen batch submit|status|fetch|cancel` transport from #11874.
This document is the design contract for the workflow layer; the user-facing
guide lives in `docs/users/features/batch.md`.

## 1. Problem and goal

PR #11874 adds the DashScope Batch API to the CLI as four transport verbs.
Used directly they are powerful but barely usable for the people the feature
is for: the user must understand their task, gather every item's materials,
hand-assemble a request JSONL, submit, wait, parse results, map them back to
files, and verify — the two steps an agent is best at (preparing inputs,
delivering outputs) are left to the user. Meanwhile the one thing the
measured data supports — fan-out of independent single-turn requests is the
shape Batch is actually cheaper for — is exactly the shape an agent can
prepare well.

Goal: the user states a bulk task in natural language, explicitly chooses
async batch mode, and later receives delivered files. The agent prepares
lightly, the Batch API executes the bulk generation, and deterministic code
owns submission, recovery, validation, delivery, and accounting.

Two product promises, kept separate:

- **Convenience** — no JSONL, no request ids, no provider concepts. This is
  always on.
- **Cheaper total cost** — the whole task (light realtime preparation +
  Batch generation + delivery + any rework) must cost less than doing the
  same work realtime to the same quality bar. This is a property of the
  task shape, never a blanket claim: Batch bills at 50% of realtime list but
  does not benefit from the context cache (measured in #11874's probes and
  documented in `docs/users/features/batch.md`).

## 2. Entry points

### `/batch --api <task>` (interactive)

The existing `/batch` skill fans out realtime worker agents; this PR adds an
explicit second mode to the same command. `BundledSkillLoader` resolves the
`--api` flag in code — mode selection is a flag, not something the model can
be talked into or out of — and swaps the skill body for
`packages/core/src/skills/bundled/batch/api-mode.md`. Without the flag,
`/batch` behaves exactly as before.

The api-mode instructions make the model do the semantic work only:

1. Judge suitability honestly (independent single-turn transforms with all
   materials available now). Unsuitable → explain and stop; never silently
   do the work realtime instead.
2. Prepare lightly — glob the files, read a 2–3 file sample, draft the
   shared rules once. Deep per-file analysis belongs to nobody: the executor
   embeds full contents mechanically.
3. Write one plan JSON to `.qwen/batch/plans/<slug>.json`.
4. Submit by running `qwen batch run <plan>` in the shell, then report the
   task id, estimate, and collect command verbatim.

### `qwen batch` workflow subcommands (deterministic executor)

| Command                   | Behavior                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run <plan>`              | Validate plan → assemble → estimate → budget gate → submit → record           |
| `collect <task-id>`       | Reconcile → poll (optional `--wait`) → download → validate → deliver → report |
| `retry <task-id>`         | Resubmit only `failed` items as a new attempt                                 |
| `list`                    | List recorded tasks with progress                                             |
| `cancel --task <task-id>` | Cancel the task's active batch (partials are still billed)                    |

`run` prints the task id and exits — waiting never burns agent turns.
`collect` is safe to run any number of times: everything already local is
reused, delivered items are never redone, and held items are re-attempted
(after the user resolves a conflict) without any new paid request.

## 3. Architecture

```text
user: /batch --api "translate docs/zh into docs/en"
        │
        ▼  (BundledSkillLoader resolves --api in code)
prepare skill (api-mode.md) — semantic work only: suitability, sample read,
shared rules, plan file. Runs realtime, keeps its own cache benefits.
        │
        ▼  plan JSON (schema in §4)
workflow executor (packages/cli/src/commands/batch-workflow.ts)
  ├─ batch-task.ts   ledger: task/item/attempt records, atomic writes
  ├─ batch-docs.ts   assemble requests, validate results, deliver files
  └─ batch-client.ts HTTP primitives with status-carrying errors
        │
        ▼
transport from #11874 (batch.ts): endpoint/auth resolution, upload, create,
status, download, cancel — reused, not duplicated.
```

Design invariants:

- **The ledger answers "which remote objects might exist?" without
  guessing.** Submit intent is persisted before upload, the uploaded file id
  before create. A lost create response becomes `submit-unknown`, reconciled
  against the provider's batch list by `input_file_id` — never blindly
  resubmitted, because the wrong answer bills twice.
- **custom_id = `<itemId>#<attempt>`**, so results map back unambiguously
  across retries; unknown/duplicate result lines are ignored with a warning.
- **Delivery is no-overwrite.** A target that exists with different content
  is a conflict to report; an identical existing target counts as delivered,
  which is what makes re-collection idempotent. Sources are re-hashed before
  writing — a source that changed after submission holds its result.
- **Usage stays out of the interactive session's realtime cache statistics.**
  The workflow runs in its own process and records usage in the task ledger;
  Batch's `cached_tokens: 0` can never dilute the realtime cache-hit rate
  displayed for interactive use.
- **No monetary estimate without prices.** Token estimates are always shown
  (rough, chars/3). Dollar estimates exist only when
  `QWEN_BATCH_INPUT_PRICE_PER_1M_USD` and
  `QWEN_BATCH_OUTPUT_PRICE_PER_1M_USD` are set — a hardcoded price table
  would go stale against the provider's pricing page. A plan may set
  `maxCostUsd`; without prices the budget cannot be enforced and `run`
  refuses to submit.

## 4. Plan schema (v1)

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "translate-docs",
  "kind": "document-transform",
  "completionWindow": "24h",
  "maxCostUsd": 2.0,
  "maxOutputTokens": 4096,
  "expectedOutputTokensPerItem": 1500,
  "enableThinking": false,
  "shared": {
    "system": "optional system prompt",
    "instructions": "shared rules: terminology, style, output contract"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "intro",
      "source": "docs/zh/intro.md",
      "target": "docs/en/intro.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

Enforced by `batch-task.ts`: item ids match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,63}`
(they ride inside provider custom_ids), ids and targets are unique, unknown
fields are rejected (an agent's typo must fail loudly, not silently change
behavior). Only the optional fields above are optional; `kind` is literal —
new kinds get their own schema version.

The first product contract is **one source document → one complete target
document**. The model returns content only; paths or commands inside its
output are data and are never executed. Delivery validates structure (non-
empty, no truncation, no tool calls, balanced markdown fences) — structure
is not semantic quality, which remains the user's acceptance call.

## 5. Boundary behaviors

| Boundary                                   | Behavior                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unsuitable task (needs iterative feedback) | Skill explains and stops; no silent realtime fallback                                       |
| Source path escapes project root           | Assembly refuses before anything is uploaded                                                |
| Assembled line > 1 MB                      | Refused with a pointer to raw `qwen batch submit` (workflow cap, below the provider's 6 MB) |
| Create returns definite 4xx                | Orphan upload deleted, items `failed`, `retry` is safe                                      |
| Create answer lost (5xx / dropped socket)  | `submit-unknown`; `collect` reconciles via the provider list; no resubmit                   |
| Reconcile finds 0 or 2+ candidates         | Report and stop; the provider list is the source of truth                                   |
| Batch not settled at collect               | Report status; `--wait` polls with 10s→60s backoff up to `--timeout`                        |
| Result line truncated / tool calls / empty | Item `failed` with the reason; billed-failure costs stay visible                            |
| Result custom_id unknown or duplicated     | Ignored with a warning, never mapped onto another item                                      |
| Error-file line                            | Item `failed` with the provider's error                                                     |
| Item missing from all result files         | Item `failed` ("no result line")                                                            |
| Source changed after submission            | Delivery `held` with the reason; re-collect after reverting                                 |
| Target exists with different content       | Delivery `held`; user resolves, re-collect delivers from the local record                   |
| Target path symlinks out of the project    | Delivery `held`                                                                             |
| `--task` cancel on a settled batch         | Points at `collect` instead of pretending to cancel                                         |
| Remote cleanup after collect               | Input/output/error files deleted (after local persistence); `--keep-remote` opts out        |

Retry semantics: only `failed` items, as a new attempt with fresh
`#<attempt>` custom ids; refused while an ambiguous submission exists or an
earlier batch is still running. Held items are never retried — they need a
user decision, not a new request.

## 6. Cost model

The executor compares nothing automatically — the user explicitly chose
Batch by entering `--api` mode — but it must not lie about money:

- Batch pricing: 50% of realtime list for successful requests, no context
  cache. Whether that beats realtime for a given job depends on the shared
  prefix fraction and output share (`docs/users/features/batch.md` derives
  the break-even math). The prepare skill keeps suitable tasks in the shape
  where Batch wins (item content dwarfs shared instructions, or outputs are
  long).
- Realtime preparation is deliberately cheap: the skill reads a sample, not
  every file; the executor embeds full contents mechanically. If the agent
  must deeply analyze each item to prepare it, the task is not in this
  workflow's sweet spot and the skill should say so.
- Rework is accounted: failed items retry visibly (new attempt, new usage);
  held items deliver from local records for free; nothing auto-retries in a
  loop.
- Estimates are labeled estimates. The provider bill is authoritative.

## 7. Verification

- Unit tests (`packages/cli/src/commands/batch-task.test.ts`,
  `batch-docs.test.ts`, `batch-workflow.test.ts`): plan validation, ledger
  atomicity and schema guard, assembly refusal on escaping paths, result
  classification, delivery conflict/change/idempotency, the full submit →
  settle → collect → retry lifecycle against a fake `WorkflowApi`, ambiguous
  create reconciliation, `--wait` backoff, budget gates.
- `BundledSkillLoader.test.ts`: `/batch --api` swaps in api-mode.md and
  strips the flag; plain `/batch` keeps the parallel-worker body.
- Manual end-to-end (fake HTTP server, isolated HOME, real built CLI):
  `run → collect (running) → collect --wait → delivered files → idempotent
re-collect → list → failure → retry → held → resolve → delivered →
cancel`. All checks pass; no real API is touched.
- The existing `qwen batch submit|status|fetch|cancel` behavior is unchanged
  (its test suite passes unmodified).

## 8. Non-goals (deliberate)

- No automatic realtime/batch router, no paid probing runs, no auto-repair
  loops. The user picks the mode; the program keeps it honest.
- No multi-stage dependency graphs; one settled batch per attempt.
- No per-turn agent loop over Batch (measured and rejected in #11874).
- No generic result protocol: only the document-transform contract is
  implemented. Code-patch delivery (apply + build + test) is a future kind
  with its own acceptance checks, not an assumption to bake in now.
